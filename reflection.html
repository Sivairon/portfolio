Intro to Robotics
</h1>

<p> I've always thought Robotics was cool and I still think it's cool. 
I'm excited for robots to get more advanced and do things that we never thought was possible for a robot to do.
I am nervous about what people would do with espicially advanced robots. 
There are a lot of positive, but many negatives, to the advancement of robots. </p>

<h1> Blinking LED's</h>
<p> For the LED light show, we tried to get the lights to go to the beat of our song, Twinkle Twinkle Little star. 
I think our team work would've improved if we mapped out how each note would go and which LED would light when that note hits. 
If we had the same idea of LED's, then our projects would've came out smoother.
</p>
<p> The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch is to have functions, ex. void loop. Other functions may include the configuring of which pin is being used.
  pinMode(); to tell the arduino which pin the LED is attached to // pinWrite(); to tell the LED to light HIGH or LOW // delay(); telling how long the LED should stay lit or off </p>

<h1>Dance Party</h>
<p>I now know that you need resistors to limit the power of the pin because if you don't, it could destroy the robot.
   I also know that you need to attach a black wire to GND (ground), which is the output of the power.
  </p>
<p> My favorite part of my robot's dance is when it spins 360's. It's entertaining to watch even though it can get a little dizzy.
     I kind of wish the robot was faster so I can do more things with it. AND IT TURNS SO SLOWLYYYY CRIII
