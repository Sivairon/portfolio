<h1>
Intro to Robotics
</h1>

<p> I've always thought Robotics was cool and I still think it's cool. 
I'm excited for robots to get more advanced and do things that we never thought was possible for a robot to do.
I am nervous about what people would do with espicially advanced robots. 
There are a lot of positive, but many negatives, to the advancement of robots. </p>

<h1> Blinking LED's</h1>
<p> For the LED light show, we tried to get the lights to go to the beat of our song, Twinkle Twinkle Little star. 
I think our team work would've improved if we mapped out how each note would go and which LED would light when that note hits. 
If we had the same idea of LED's, then our projects would've came out smoother.
  
</p>
<p> The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch is to have functions, ex. void loop. Other functions may include the configuring of which pin is being used.
  pinMode(); to tell the arduino which pin the LED is attached to // pinWrite(); to tell the LED to light HIGH or LOW // delay(); telling how long the LED should stay lit or off </p>

<h1>Dance Party</h1>
<p>I now know that you need resistors to limit the power of the pin because if you don't, it could destroy the robot.
   I also know that you need to attach a black wire to GND (ground), which is the output of the power.
  </p>
<p> My favorite part of my robot's dance is when it spins 360's. It's entertaining to watch even though it can get a little dizzy.
     I kind of wish the robot was faster so I can do more things with it. AND IT TURNS SO SLOWLYYYY CRIII

<h1> What is a MVC paradigm? How is it used? </h1>
<p>MVC (Model-view-controller) is a pattern used in a user-relating interface in order to create data models.
There is M (Model) which is used to display your data. The V (view) is what you see on the page depending on the user input. The C (controller) controls what is shown on the model depending on the user input (in view)
It is like a chart that shows cause and effect (which depends on the view... user input.</p>

<h1> What is the difference between a framework and a library?</h1>
<p> the difference is that a library has a specific collection which is being shown/displayed, 
  while a framework is the hidden functions of the application.</p>

<h1> Why might you use a framework instead of creating an app yourself?</h1>
<p> People would use framework instead of creating an app yourself is because, with a framework, everything (the basics) is already created for you.
  If you use framework, you can add unique features to your application without going through the basics and getting the general functions of the app.</p>

<h1> What stage would you like to be at in your Django tutorials? </h1>
<p> I would like to be done with this Django tutorial. but... if I had to choose it would be making my html PRETTY (ugly). </p>
<h1> What other sites could you create with the same structure as you used in your portfolio page?</h1>
<p>I could create informative sites that give very quality content information... about something. Same as portfolio? you mean blog? Dhjango? Python? I guess you can create a game on your site then.</p>
<h1>What would you like more practice using?</h1> 
<p> I would like to practice using my brain a little more because reading hurts. Just kidding... no I'm not, but I would like to practice using Python a little more because I want to create a game with it.</p>
<h1>What do you not understand at all yet?</h1>
<p> Why coding hurts my brain... I don't exactly understand how servers work entirely yet. Server are very confusing to me. Also css and html are still a big blob in my head. </p>
